# Deep ML

A repository for my solutions to the problems on [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/), a site for leetcode-style questions for machine learning and data science. For each problem, I decided to use either `numpy` or pure python depending on the type signature of the method, i.e. if the method takes in 2 `np.array`s, then I use `numpy` else Python.
